# what is `in_place/`?

basically in order to make a workflow that works efficiently, I made the tools up a directory able to be used on one file instead of an entire mcdata repo

# What each tool does:

## extract_block_lootTables.js

adds more to the `drops` section of blocks from blocks.json (using items.json)

## patch_states.js

adds `defaultState` to blocks from blocks.json
